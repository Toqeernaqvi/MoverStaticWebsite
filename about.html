  <h2>Pre-cautions taken During the Move Process.</h2>
  <div class="container precaution__container">
      In this section, we would like to let our beloved customers know what precautions EzeeyMover is taking against the COVID-19 pandemic.
      
     <h4 class="precaution__h">These are some of the key actions that we would like for our customers to perform:</h4>
     <ul>
       <li class="li">If the customer believes that they would like to pack some of the personal items by themselves, make sure to demand the boxes one day before the move. The delivery person will be wearing gloves while delivering the boxes so there is no human contact at the door. Keep a safe distance from them when receiving the boxes.</li>
       <li class="li">If a survey is needed, make sure to wear a mask once the surveyor arrives and always keep a safe distance while showing the surveyor the items that need to be moved.</li>
       <li class="li">On the moving day, let the team do their work and keep a distance from them. As the team will be wearing masks and gloves, make sure you wear a mask and gloves as well.</li>
       <li class="li last-child">
        Once the move is done and the payment method is selected as cash, leave the cash on the table and tell the supervisor to pick it up, count, and then leave. This method is preferred and respected by the workers since it minimizes the risk of exposure.</li>
     </ul> 

     <h4 class="precauton__h">
      These are the precautions we take:
     </h4>
     <ul>
       <li class="li">Our team is subjected to weekly tests to ensure zero COVID-positive workers.</li>
       <li class="li">Wear gloves and mask at all times during the survey, on moving day, and on the delivery day.</li>
       <li class="li">Have a sanitizer on them at all times and use them before the move and then wear the gloves. One cannot be too careful.</li>
       <li class="li">The team will keep a safe distance from our customers as they care about themselves and our beloved customers as well.</li>
       <li class="li">Our team will do everything by themselves so the only requirement they expect the customer is to supervise and let the team know where to place the item. Our team will ask you to only point. We would like to avoid any close contact between our customers and the team.</li>
       <li class="li">If the team member is sick or having symptoms that display COVID-19, we send them home to recover and only report after a complete recovery. For us, health is the first priority second to work.</li>
     </ul>
     <h4 class="precaution__h2">Stay Safe, Stay Healthy, and Move Safe and healthy.</h4>
